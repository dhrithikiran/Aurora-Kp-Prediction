# Kp-Index-Prediction
Predict Kp index 30–90 minutes ahead. Then interpret Kp → aurora visibility.

# What is Kp Index?
- A number (0 to 9) that measures how disturbed Earth’s magnetic field is.
- Basically, Low Kp → calm geomagnetic field _→ aurora unlikely_
  while High Kp → geomagnetic storm → _aurora likely_ and visible far from poles
- Our goal is to Predict Kp before it happens using solar wind data. 
- Kp index can be used to predict the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis)
  
We will be using predictive analytics on time-series data.
